/* fs-fit — the theme's ONE "does it still fit?" engine; add fit logic here, do not grow a second

 * container): does the menu fit beside the brand, is a table still readable? Both were once
 * breakpoints (one @media, five @container thresholds) — guessed numbers that real routers got
 * wrong, useless for a third-party luci-app-* table of unknown column count.
 *
 * THREE RULES, each a bug that was hit:
 *  1. MEASURE UNCOLLAPSED — a collapsed thing always "fits" (a stacked table is a pile of flex
 *     rows): read it as it stands and it un-collapses, next frame re-collapses. Oscillation.
 *  2. RE-FIT SYNCHRONOUSLY ON A MUTATION — the poll re-renders content once a second and the
 *     fresh element has lost our class. A MutationObserver callback is a microtask (pre-paint),
 *     rAF runs AT paint: deferring there painted a stacked table one frame at full width —
 *     19-109px of overflow, once a second, on Firewall/DHCP/Wireless.
 *  3. COALESCE ON RESIZE — every fit forces a synchronous layout.
 *
 * ResizeObserver, not onresize: a rail collapse and a layout toggle change the content width
 * without resizing the window. */

	 *
	 * Every other "does it fit" question here is asked of the browser. This one cannot be: it is
	 * exactly the table's min-content width, and `overflow-wrap: anywhere` (base/40-tables.css) makes
	 * the browser answer ONE CHARACTER per column. That is deliberate — an unbreakable ICCID must not
	 * push a table nobody measures out of its card — but it means a measured table can be starved to
	 * a ribbon of fragments and still report, truthfully, that it fits. Asking the engine the honest
	 * question by flipping `overflow-wrap` for one layout does not work either: Blink returns the same
	 * min-content for `normal`, `break-word` and `anywhere` on a table (measured — 645px in all three,
	 * with the widest word alone needing 367), so the number simply is not available from layout.
	 *
	 * So compute it: per COLUMN, the width of the widest WORD any of its cells has to show, plus that
	 * cell's own side padding; summed across columns. A `nowrap`/`pre` column takes its whole text
	 * instead, because that is what it has committed to showing. Nothing here is a threshold — the
	 * result is the table's content measured in the table's own fonts, so every table gets its own
	 * number and none was picked by anyone.
	 *
	 * Two approximations, both stated rather than hidden:
	 *  - the FONT is sampled once per column, from the first data row. A column that changes face
	 *    row by row would be measured in the first row's; no LuCI table does that, and the
	 *    alternative is a `getComputedStyle` per cell, which is the expensive call here.
	 *  - the widest word is picked by CHARACTER COUNT and only that one is measured, so a column of
	 *    one font is one `measureText` per new maximum instead of one per cell. Within a single font
	 *    that ranks `iiii` above `WWW`; it costs a few px on the floor and takes the walk over
	 *    Processes (114 rows) from 6ms to about 1ms.
	 *
	 * A `colSpan` cell contributes its whole floor to one column, which over-states that column and
	 * under-states its neighbours by the same amount — the sum, which is what the caller compares, is
	 * unaffected. */

		 * worth: fs-select's fitTables() strips `fs-stacked` BEFORE it measures (rule 1), and this is
