 * stand — a census of `#view table:not(.table):not(.cbi-section-table)` over all 196 menu pages,
 * openclash / justclash / ssclash / dashboard / statistics included, found ZERO. That is the point:

 * element — the rows present at that moment were adopted and captioned, and every batch after it
 * kept neither `.tr`/`.td` nor `data-title`, on a table that by then may carry `.fs-stacked`, where

/* ---- CARD-STACK A DATA TABLE THAT NO LONGER FITS --------------------------------
 *
 * Measuring, scheduling and the observers are fs-fit.js; this file supplies only the DECISION.
 * A data table used to card by @container at THREE thresholds (568 plain, 780 leases, 800 apk
 * package list), the last two each carrying their own COPY of the card rules — CSS cannot share
 * a block across two thresholds. All were really asking "does it OVERFLOW?", a fact the browser
 * computes, so it is measured instead: the card rules live once in theme/30-tables.css on
 * .fs-stacked, and a third-party table of unknowable width works too.
 *
 * A CONFIG table (.cbi-section-table) keeps its @container (960, theme/65-dropdown.css) and must
 * NOT be measured: its rows hold widgets (enhance() above turns every <select> into a
 * ui.Dropdown) and a widget bakes in the width of the layout it was laid out in, so
 * un-collapsing it to read it CHANGES what is read. Measured on the router: the firewall zone
 * table then reported needing 1747px where it really needs 1190px and overflowed its section by
 * 557px — an overflow the CSS-only version never had. A data table has no widgets, which is why
 * it is the one that gets measured. */
const STACKABLE = '#view .table.fs-dt';

/* "Too cramped to be a table any more" — a DESIGN judgement. It has to be one: these tables do
 * NOT overflow when the room runs out (their cells break anywhere), they compress into an
 * unreadable ribbon. Do NOT give the cells a min-width so that "cramped" MANUFACTURES an
 * overflow: tried, and it carded the firewall's zone table at 1420px and still overflowed by
 * 39px once carded — a floor big enough to force the overflow is big enough to break the card. */

						 * so 600 -> 568 of room. A fixed number and not a re-read of that token on
						 * purpose: the threshold is the DESIGN judgement above, and Compact density
						 * shrinking the gutter to 10px is not a reason to keep a table wider. */

/* The ribbon has one more shape, and CRAMPED cannot see it: the table has room by the number
 * above and still shreds its FIRST column, because auto table layout hands width out by what
 * each column DEMANDS. The leftmost column is the row's identity and usually the least greedy —
 * a wide neighbour (a hostname plus an IPv6, a modulation string) simply takes the width, and
 * `overflow-wrap: anywhere` (theme/30-tables.css) lets the identity be squeezed with no floor:
 * it breaks mid-word rather than overflow, so there is no overflow for fit.overflows() to read.
 *
 * Measured on the router (Wireless, one station, `Access Point "vaka_devices" (phy6-ap0)`):
 * viewport 900 -> the column is 101px and 5 lines, 850 -> 80px and 7, 800 -> 76px and 8, and at
 * NO width did the table card — a nine-line tower of half-words next to columns with room to
 * spare (issue #7). Below 767 the MAC column drops out (the stock phone contract) and the
 * column springs back to 167px, which is why this only ever bit between roughly 780 and 900.
 *
 * So: past this many lines the identity has stopped being readable and the card view — which
 * gives every field its own labelled row — is simply better. A DESIGN judgement like CRAMPED,
 * and it has to be one: any number of lines is legible in isolation. 5 is what the reporter

 *
 * `idTower` above is deliberately first-column-only, on the grounds that "a value column wrapping to
 * a few lines is a value being shown, not a table falling apart". That held right up until the value
 * was one unbreakable token: `overflow-wrap: anywhere` gave such a cell a min-content of ONE
 * CHARACTER, so auto table layout was free to starve its column to one character, and `overflows()`
 * then reported — truthfully, uselessly — that the table fit. Reported from a hardware router at
 * 700-790px of window: the v4 lease table cards there (its `nowrap` columns give it a floor, so it
 * really does overflow) while the v6 table beside it shredded the DUID, measured at 5 lines with
 * 674px of room and 7 at 654px, against 1 line at 1160px.
 *
 * A first pass answered it with a line count, which is a number somebody picks. This asks the table
 * instead: `fit.wordFloor()` returns the narrowest the table can be without breaking a word through —
 * per column, the widest WORD it must show, in that column's own font, summed. Past that width the
 * browser has to cut through a value, and the card view is what shows values whole. So every table
 * carries its own breakpoint, derived from its own content, and no threshold was chosen anywhere.
 *
 * On the reporting router, at 1190px of room: leases6 asks for 935, the associated-stations table
 * for 966, the v4 leases for 645, Processes for 794, Connections for 550 and Startup for 381 — so

 * is taken in the same layout. This theme cards it under `@container fs-content (max-width: 960px)`
 * (theme/65-dropdown.css), where the actions cell is `flex: 1 1 100%` and its buttons deliberately
 * spread across the whole card — so a measurement taken there is the CARD's width, and carrying it
 * into table mode makes the column absurd.
 *
 * Measured on the router, Network -> Firewall -> Zones: loaded at 1000px (carded) and grown to
 * 1280px, the actions column pins 634px, the table renders 1267px inside a 1056px content column and
 * the column scrolls sideways by 256px — permanently, because upstream's own re-measure reads the
 * pin. A FRESH load at 1280px renders the same table at 966px with a 192px actions column. Shrinking,
 * and growing within table mode, were always fine; it is the card -> table crossing that breaks.
 *
 * So drop the pin whenever the layout it was measured in stops being the layout on screen. Upstream
 * re-measures from a clean DOM on its own resize listener and pins the right number; if it does not,
 * the natural width is what we wanted anyway.
 *
 * THE KEY IS THE ROOM, NOT THE MODE, and starting from the mode alone missed half of it: the card ->
 * table crossing is one way a pin goes stale, and the card simply getting NARROWER is the other. At
 * 768px this theme has no sidebar (data-narrow) and the column is 712px; at 800px the sidebar returns
 * and the column is 520px — the viewport grew, the room shrank, and the table was carded on both
 * sides, so a mode test sees no change at all. Measured: firewall/zones and wireless both kept a
 * `min-width: 670px` cell in a 520px column, 154px of scroll. Keying on the room catches both, since
 * a mode change cannot happen without one.
 *
 * The room is the parent's content box (fit.roomFor), which the table's own width does not feed back
 * into — so wiping the pin cannot change the key and set this oscillating. It fires once per CHANGE,
 * never per tick, so it does not fight upstream for the pin on a polled page. */

		 * stabilizeActionColumnWidth ends by attaching `window.addEventListener('resize', …)` once per

		 * ever removes it. On a stock theme the next page is a full load and the listener dies with the
		 * document; here the document lives for the whole session, so every visit to a config page
		 * leaves another listener holding another detached table.
		 *

		 * 18 520 EventListener and 1 160 <form> — a straight 11.8 KB per navigation that never
		 * plateaus once the module cache is full.
		 *
		 * Setting the flag before upstream reaches it means the listener is never attached, and nothing
		 * is lost: what it existed to do — re-measure the column when the width changes — is what the
		 * wipe below now does, from the room rather than from a window event. The fitter runs
		 * SYNCHRONOUSLY on the mutation batch that inserts the table (fs-fit rule 2), which is what
